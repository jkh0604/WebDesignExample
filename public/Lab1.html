  <h1>Lab 1</h1>
  <div id="body">
    <p>This is a simple lab to setup the directory structure for the later labs.</p>
    <p>The server is a copy of the Labs from the previous weeks.  In this lab you will create a copy of the Book folder and rename it to with with your Assignment 1 and Assignment 3 content.</p>
    <p>Copy the book application now and rename it to match your Assignment 1 and Assignment 3 content</p>
    <p>Rename each of the files - bookController.js, bookData.json, and bookModel.json to match your content</p>
    <p>Update the bookController.js and bookModel.js to match your content.  In both, you only need methods to return all content.  (ie. you dont need a method to delete content or get content by id or category)</p> 
    <p>Copy your appData.json from Assignment 3 into the appData.json</p> 
    <p>In the /routes directory, copy Book.js and rename it appropriately.  Make note of the commented line in the router.  Since you only have a method to get all content, this commented line is all you need.</p>
    <p>Finally, update app.js - create a app.use for your own content.  Be sure to include the appropriate router.</p>

    <p>To test, open the path you created and verify your json data is returned.  If it did not, then you need to debug!</p>
